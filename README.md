Made a weather app with react. I'v made weather apps before, but using react for this was different. 

I had the most trouble chaining my API requests to each other. It took a lot of time to get my final API call to get the data on the first call. After getting the API data, it was fast and easy to plug into the jsx. 

Deplying to GH-Pages is a chore.
